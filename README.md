# NEXTBOOK

Many avid readers suffer from Reading List Paralysis: you finish a book, and you're overwhelmed by your overflowing bookshelf. How to pick just one?

NextBook stops RLP before it starts by providing one tailored book suggestion a day, for anyone with a Goodreads account. When a user signs up, NextBook pulls their book ratings from the Goodreads API, then retrieves additional book data from the Google Books & OpenLibrary APIs. Multiple machine learning models are trained on each user's ratings; the most accurate model selects books to recommend from NextBook's library. Users are emailed just one title per day, avoiding option overload entirely! Feedback is collected on every suggestion, so NextBook can improve recommendations over time.

## History
