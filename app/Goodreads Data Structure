BIBLIOGRAPHICS:

For each book:
    - using Goodreads, get:
        - author
        - original title
        - ISBN 
        - original publish year
        - (publisher?)
        - num of pages
        - popular shelves (might stand in for some genre info...?)
        - links to purchase on various sites
        - series data:
            - series name
            - series id
            - from there: get other books in the series
    - using ISBN & http://isbndb.com: 
        - get library of congress id
        - get Dewey Decimal number; get subjects from there?
    - Proj Guttenberg:
        - Subject: data is about 50% complete here
        - what else is there like Proj G?


*** really need:
    - genre info (Google Books API)
    - look for static dumps of book data rather than querying APIs
    - Can I just build a database of about 10,000 books with rich data and going from there?

** beware of throttling!!!

** beware of trying to connect tons of APIs together; that is complex and will suck up tons of time

- amazon: can i get book data from there?
- wikipedia book data
- this will only work for me, so... set of books can be small


CHECK OUT:
snap (from Stanford): provides Amazon's categories for tons of books
* Jonathan's song recommender on Github

NEED TO BUILD
- a database of 10,000 most popular books on Goodreads
- get all their attribute data to be my "recommending from" corpus
** need to create genre mapping


ALSO AVAILABLE FROM GOODREADS:
- ratings data:
    - rating distribution (# with 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 stars)
