PROCESS FOR RUNNING TIMED REDIS JOBS

Start running redis:
$ redis-server
# to run in background:
$ redis-server &



Start running RQ worker:
$ rq worker
# to run in background:
$ rq worker &



Start running RQ scheduler:
$ rqscheduler
# to run in background:
$ rqscheduler &



NOW YOU CAN SCHEDULE JOBS.

In a Python file:

from redis import Redis
from rq_scheduler import Scheduler

# Create a scheduler object with your Redis server.
scheduler = Scheduler(connection=redis_server)

## in app: be sure to clear scheduled jobs before adding new ones! Otherwise there will be duplicates created when you start your app

# decide when to start job
time = datetime(2016, 3, 3, 2, 10)

scheduler.schedule(
    scheduled_time=time, # Time for first execution, in UTC timezone
    func=print_greeting,        # Function to be queued
    args = ["Emma"],            # any function arguments
    interval=120,                   # Time before the function is called again, in seconds
    repeat=5                      # Repeat this number of times (None means repeat forever)
)
