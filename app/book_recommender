- generate a taste vector for user
- look for books with similar 'profile' to that taste vector

- how to use larger categories to create more than one 


** goal of content filtering is to find latent features that underlie those broad categories
    ** so ideally, recommender engine will generate books that will be appealing to user
    ** no matter what 'categories' they are in


1: normalize features: weight heavily features that are less frequent
    - common way of doing this: tf-idf : sciKit learn has a module for this
    - transform full book feature space : not just user's rated books
        - for tfidf: need all your attributes to be binary; 
            - but otherwise binary is not necessary
2: once features are normalized, generate user "best book" profile
3: match that profile to existing books to create recommendations!
4: filter out:
    - books already read
    - books with same name as books already read (editions problem)


** is it possible to have a validation set? sciKit learn has machinery for cross-validation; 
- is this too optimistic time-wise?


using "want to read" books:
- is this more for discovery or more for just decision-making?
- validation set?
- a way to check on whether users actually follow through on my recommendations?
